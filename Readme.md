# Analysis of Data on Alcohol Consumption in Students

### Description

This project focuses on the analysis of a data set that provides information on student behavior in relation to alcohol consumption and various socio-educational factors. Through tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib in Python, various explorations and visualizations have been carried out to better understand the relationships and patterns present in the data.

### Analysis Content

Initial Exploration

#### Data Set Dimensions:

The dimensions of the data set were examined using the shape function.

#### Data Types and Null Values:

The structure of the data set was checked using dtypes and a search for null values was performed.

### Correlation Analysis

#### Correlation Matrix:

The correlation matrix was calculated to understand the linear relationships between numerical variables.
Notable correlations were observed, such as the positive relationship between grades in different periods and the negative correlation between age and some grades.
